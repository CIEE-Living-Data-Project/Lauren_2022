Repository for Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution 2022W1

Hello! Welcome to my project for the class Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution 2022W1. I am analyzing data from Kruger National Park that systematically recorded presences of large mammals on roads within the park. My question is to compare the number of animals present on dirt roads versus tarmac roads. Data available at: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bcc2fqzd1
